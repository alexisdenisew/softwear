    <p id = "regText">Alexis Denise Williams is a creative technologist, educator, and activist with a profound dedication to using technology and art to address social and environmental challenges. As the founder of Softwear by Lex, she tackles the issue of electronic waste by transforming discarded tech into interactive, wearable art. This innovative approach won the NYU Tandon School of Engineering’s Technology, Culture and Society Best Senior Project award, highlighting her unique blend of creativity and technical skill.</p>
    <p id = "regText">Softwear by Lex seeks to address the critical issue of electronic waste (e-waste), which is one of the fastest growing waste streams globally. E-waste encompasses discarded electronic appliances and devices that are no longer in use. As technology rapidly evolves, products quickly become obsolete, leading to an estimated 420.3 million metric tons of e-waste produced annually—a figure that's predicted to double by 2050. The disposal of these items poses significant environmental hazards due to the toxic substances they contain, which can leach into soil and water, thereby harming ecosystems and human health. The mishandling of e-waste disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly in the Global South, where much of the world's e-waste is illegally dumped.</p>
    <p id = "regText">In response to this daunting challenge, Softwear by Lex transforms e-waste into interactive, wearable art using microcontrollers, 3D printed components, and recycled electronic parts. By repurposing defunct tech, Alexis's creations serve not only as fashion pieces but also as educational tools and conversation starters about sustainable tech practices.</p>
    <p id = "regText">The mission of Softwear by Lex extends beyond creating unique apparel. It aims to reshape societal attitudes towards the lifespan of technology and promote responsible consumption practices. The initiative highlights the importance of innovative approaches in e-waste management by demonstrating how technological creativity can contribute to environmental sustainability. Through the platform, Alexis educates her audience on the complexities of e-waste and encourages collective action towards addressing this critical issue.</p>
